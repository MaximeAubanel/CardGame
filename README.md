THE RULES

You must build a multi-client / server solution where the client represent a player and the server
the game master. The game you have to implement is a Card Game, any of them.


TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS

The goal here is not to go through the process of rewriting your own version of something
already done, nor to write many lines of code.
We rather demands you to behave as a Software architect and to integrate existing library
in your solution

Create and maintain the connection between a client and a server.
Also think about multi-client management and asynchronous functions so that the program
doesnâ€™t jam up

To have your server communicate with its clients, you need to implement your own RFC.
